#### It's been a couple of months since I've coded anything, so this is my way back in
#### I've always been fascinated by designing and tracking e-mails ever since I started buying from Appsumo. I loved not only their products, but their campaigns.
#### Currently, I am designing e-mails for friends to practice. I aim to make my campaigns larger so I can learn how to track e-mails.
#### This interest in e-mail came back because of the frontendmasters course called <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/responsive-email/">"Responsive HTML Email Design"</a>
